The IRS source data is readily available at https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/. All of the source code behind the Service can be found on Github at https://github.com/grantmakers/grantmakers.github.io.</p>
						<h5>Revisions and Errata</h5>
						<p>The materials appearing in our Service could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

						<h5>Links To Other Web Sites</h5>
						<p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Grantmakers.io.</p>
						<p>Grantmakers.io has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services.

						<h5>Termination</h5>
						<p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
						<p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
						<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
						<p>The materials in our Service are provided "as is".

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
						<h5>Governing Law</h5>
						<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Illinois, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
						<h5>Changes</h5>
						<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
